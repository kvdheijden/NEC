# NEC
Nintendo Emulator Collection

Currently in development:
* GameBoy

# TODO List
* Implement pixel pipeline for sprites (OBJ).
* Continue with LR35902 instructions. Currently enough instructions have been implemented to run :
  * GameBoy BIOS
  * Tetris main menu
* Implement sound using SDL Audio
* Update display to work with more OpenGL versions and OpenGL ES (or maybe using SDL, might be more convenient)
* Some sort of testing might be nice
